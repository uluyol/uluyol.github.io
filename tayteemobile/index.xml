      <description>(I missed last week, so this is really Week 3, but whatever.) Since the last post, I received some new information about vehicle requirements which are summarized below:
The tayteemobile must have a high ride — this assumption was right — but a Honda CR-V would be high enough. A five-seater is big enough, no need to fit seven. Price: $10–12K. The price target will be hard to hit, but we can try to get close.</description>

      <description>This post begins our search for the perfect tayteemobile — the type of vehicle driven by your resident taytee. Over the following weeks, we will explore different vehicles and price points, and we will see whether anything can replace this magnificence:
