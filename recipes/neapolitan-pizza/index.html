			<p>Makes 6 pizzas using a cast-iron skillet.
Tastes really good but the recipe is quite involved —
you&rsquo;ll need to use both your oven&rsquo;s broil setting and the cooktop.</p>
<h2 id="dough">Dough</h2>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li class="txt-flour">4 cups flour</li>
<li class="txt-salt-dough">2 &frac14; tsp salt</li>
<li class="txt-yeast">1 tsp instant yeast</li>
<li class="txt-sugar-dough">2 tsp sugar</li>
<li class="txt-water">12 oz water</li>
<li class="txt-oil-dough">Olive oil for working on the counter top (if you want, you can dust flour instead)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Combine <span class="txt-flour">flour</span>,
<span class="txt-salt-dough">salt</span>,
<span class="txt-yeast">yeast</span>, and
<span class="txt-sugar-dough">sugar</span> in the bowl of a stand
mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Whisk to combine.
Add <span class="txt-water">water</span> and knead on low speed
until mixture just comes together and no dry flour remains.
Rest for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Knead on low speed for an additional 10 minutes.
The mixture should come together into a cohesive mass that barely
sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads.
Depending on the type of flour used, you may need to add up to
½ cup additional <span class="txt-flour">flour</span>.
If dough sticks heavily to bottom of bowl, add an extra
1 tablespoon of <span class="txt-flour">flour</span> at a time
with mixer running until it forms a mass that just barely sticks
to the bowl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(First Prove) Cover bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the
dough to two gallon-sized zipper lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 72 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively,</strong> if making the pizza in the same day,
leave bowl in a warm area to rise for a few hours after covering
with plastic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer dough to a work surface lightly covered with
<span class="txt-oil-dough">olive oil</span>
(or dusted with flour). Using a bench scraper, divide dough into
six even pieces, approximately 6 ounces each.
Using <span class="txt-oil-dough">oiled</span> (or floured) hands,
shape each piece into a neat ball by gathering dough towards the
bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Second Prove) Coat the bottom of a baking tray with
<span class="txt-oil-dough">olive oil</span> and evenly spread the dough balls across the tray so that they don&rsquo;t merge during the
second prove.
Lightly cover the of dough balls with
<span class="txt-oil-dough">oil</span>.
Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room
temperature for 2 hours (dough should roughly double in volume).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sauce">Sauce</h2>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li class="txt-oil-sauce">6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li class="txt-garlic">8 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</li>
<li class="txt-tomatoes">800g of canned San Marzano plum tomatoes. It's OK to use something cheaper, but since it's a major component of the sauce, I would pick something high quality. Typically, I use one 400g can of San Marzano tomatoes and one can of a cheaper variety</li>
<li class="txt-lemon">Juice of &frac12; lemon</li>
<li class="txt-sugar-sauce">&frac14; tsp sugar</li>
<li class="txt-salt-sauce">Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the tomato sauce, heat the
<span class="txt-oil-sauce">olive oil</span> in a frying pan over
a medium heat. Fry the <span class="txt-garlic">garlic</span>
for 1–2 minutes on a low heat, until softened but not coloured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the <span class="txt-tomatoes">tomatoes</span> to the frying
pan and squash them as much as possible with the back of a wooden spoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring to a boil and add the
<span class="txt-lemon">lemon juice</span>,
<span class="txt-sugar-sauce">sugar</span>, and
<span class="txt-salt-sauce">salt</span>.
Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5–10 minutes,
until reduced to a sauce consistency.
Remove from the heat and taste for seasoning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="making-the-pizzas">Making the Pizzas</h2>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li class="txt-oil-pizza">Olive oil for working on the counter top (if you want, you can dust flour instead)</li>
<li class="txt-semolina">Semolina for dusting. You can substitute with cornmeal</li>
<li class="txt-cheese">12 ounces buffalo mozzarella or fresh cow's milk mozzarella</li>
<li class="txt-basil">24 basil leaves</li>
<li class="txt-toppings">Any other topping you'd like.
Some options are kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Prepare the work area:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put some <span class="txt-oil-pizza">olive oil</span> (or flour)
on your workspace (counter).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your tomato sauce,
<span class="txt-semolina">semolina</span>,
<span class="txt-cheese">drained cheese</span>,
<span class="txt-basil">basil leaves</span>,
<span class="txt-toppings">toppings</span>, and pizza dough ready and close to the
stovetop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preheat broiler to high and arrange rack so you can just barely
fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless
steel skillet on top of it. Start warming your skillet on the
stovetop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Cook each of the six pizzas:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Transfer 1 ball of dough to the work surface and gently stretch
into a 10-inch circle, leaving the outer 1-inch edge slightly
thicker than the center.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to start by gently stretching with
your fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place
it on the opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth
between your opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss
until it stretches out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return
it to the work surface. With your left hand flat in the center
of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the
dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in
diameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dust skillet with <span class="txt-semolina">semolina</span>,
tap out excess, then heat skillet over high heat until lightly
smoking (about 3 minutes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer the dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the
entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread 2 tablespoons
sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border
un-sauced. Top with ⅙ of the
<span class="txt-cheese">cheese chunks</span>.
Add additional <span class="txt-toppings">toppings</span> except
for the <span class="txt-basil">basil</span>, since it burns if
added too early.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed
and charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 ½
to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler).
Return skillet to stovetop, add
<span class="txt-basil">4 basil leaves</span> and cook until
bottom is charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek
after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may
skip this step if pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza
to a cutting board and serve immediately.</p>
</li>
